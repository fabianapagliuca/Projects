# Data Visualization Project

Descrizione:
This corpus contains two different datasets: one comprises 1,123 Italian sentences and the other one made of 1,200 English sentences, each assessed by human evaluators for their complexity. The evaluations were gathered through a crowdsourcing task involving 20 native speakers for each language. Participants were asked to rate the perceived difficulty of a given sentence on a scale ranging from 1 (indicating 'very easy') to 7 (indicating 'very difficult').

The sentences used in the task were sourced from two distinct treebanks that underwent manual review: the newspaper section of the Italian Universal Dependency Treebank (IUDT) for the Italian experiment, and the automatically converted Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank for the English experiment.

Goal: the aim of this project is to construct a model that can predict the complexity judgement for each sentence through different techniques of text mining and data visualization.

In this notebook, we will analyze the English dataset.
